            | Hi, I am Matthew. I am an aspiring Full Stack JavaScript developer. I am currently completing the Treehouse Tech Degree program for this and am looking to turn the skills that I have learned from it into a new career. Through this new challenge I have begun to develop a foundation that I hope to build on through an opportunity with a company that will value my current skillset as well as giving me the chance to further grow my abilities.
