This is my portfolio. It contains information about myself as well as my previous projects. It is built using Express through Node.js. All links to projects are generated dynamically as well as the information on the project pages themselves.

I went for the extra credit on this page by changing the package.json so that the project can be started by typing 'npm start' on the command line. I have also added templates to make my errors look nicer. I also made some design changes by adding box shadows to the project images on the index page when hovering, changing the color of the background colors of LinkedIn and GitHub link buttons, and changing the font color of the same buttons when not hovering over them as well as a different color and font when they are the focus.
