This is my portfolio. It contains information about myself as well as my previous projects. It is built using Express through Node.js. All links to projects are generated dynamically as well as the information on the project pages themselves.

I went for the extra credit on this page by changing the package.json so that the project can be started by typing 'npm start' on the command line. I have also added templates to make my errors look nicer as well as adding box shadows to the project images on the main page, adding background color, and changing the color of the text in areas.
